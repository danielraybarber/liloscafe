# liloscafe


This website was the result of 1 month of learning html, css, bootstrap, and javascript at Tech Talent South. This website is completely fake but will be used as a reference to where I started. Liloscafe is an idea me and my brother had for a real breakfast spot but has no plans to become real as of now.
